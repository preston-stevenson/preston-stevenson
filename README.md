- I’m Preston
- I love basketball, specifically the NBA and NBA analytics.
- I have a walk through for Daniel Myers BPM from basketball-reference.com, some visualizations, and some notes from a data science book I went through. I will be working to add more walk-throughs and visualization code in the near future.
